## Introduction

In July 2012 the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN LHC announced the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson. Direct measurements of the production and decay rates of the new particle, using SM decay channels, have so far played a key role in determining whether or not it is indeed consistent with the SM predictions. However, substantially increasing the precision of these measurements will require further data. Searches for Higgs bosons through production mechanisms
not predicted by the SM, or decay modes involving particles not included in the SM, provide a complementary approach and have the advantage of probing specific types of new physics models with the existing data.

This letter presents a search for the pair production of new light bosons (denoted as ‘$a$’) decaying to pairs of isolated, oppositely charged muons (dimuons). One production mechanism for these new bosons is in the decay chain of a Higgs boson $h$, which can be SM-like or not: $h \rightarrow 2a + X \rightarrow 4m + X$, where $X$ denotes possible additional particles from cascade decays of the Higgs boson. A range of new physics scenarios predict this decay topology, including the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) and models with hidden (or dark) sectors.
